simple text-based status command for sway/i3/anything else with a bar.

doesn't depend on anything other than standard c stuff

you will probably have to change the sysfs paths for your specific system, as they tend to be nonportable

just run `make` then set your bar status_command in window manager config to `/path/to/peri_status`
